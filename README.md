### Description

-> The latest technology is used in this website, React JS is used in FrontEnd, and Node Js and Express Js are used in the Backend. And the database is connected to the database using MongoDB.\

-> Buyers can buy resale laptops and sellers can sell their used laptops on this website. For that, you have to register the login and choose the account type whether it is buyer or seller.\

-> Three types of users can access this website: Buyer, Seller, and Admin. Buyers can buy a resale laptop from here. By booking a laptop, the buyer will show his products on the dashboard and the seller can add and delete his products from the dashboard. Admin can see All Sellers and All Buyers and can delete any buyer and seller.\

-> If the buyer books a laptop, then he can pay online through the card for the laptop ordered by him.\

-> The online payment system is implemented on the E-Shoppers website by using react stripe.\

-> If the seller wants to advertise any of his resale laptops, he can do so. It gives an option button from my product on its dashboard when that button is clicked. That product will show as a home page advertisement. And any buyer can see that advertisement product.
